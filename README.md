# Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------
Core Components of the Architecture

1.1. Landing Page Server

	•	Purpose: Marketing, customer onboarding, and providing information about your platform.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Hosting marketing content.
	•	Providing links to the OrderHub and PrepStation.
	•	Handling general user inquiries (e.g., a contact form).
	•	Tech Stack: Static or dynamic Next.js server.

1.2. OrderHub Server

	•	Purpose: Customer-facing application for browsing restaurants and placing orders.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Managing restaurant menus, search functionality, and filtering.
	•	Handling user authentication for customers.
	•	Initiating orders and communicating with PrepStation.
	•	Tech Stack: Next.js with server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO, potentially integrated with Firebase or a similar cloud messaging service.

1.3. PrepStation Server

	•	Purpose: Business-facing application for restaurant management.
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Managing orders placed through OrderHub.
	•	Handling menu updates, restaurant details, and availability.
	•	Receiving order notifications from OrderHub.
	•	Tech Stack: Next.js for the dashboard, with integration for real-time communication (e.g., WebSockets or cloud messaging).
--------------------------------------------------------------
Communication Between Services

For microservices, inter-service communication is critical. Here are the primary options:

2.1. REST API

	•	How It Works:
	•	Each service exposes endpoints (e.g., /api/orders or /api/restaurants).
	•	OrderHub makes HTTP requests to PrepStation to update the restaurant dashboard when an order is placed.
	•	Pros:
	•	Simple and well-supported.
	•	Easy to debug and integrate.
	•	Cons:
	•	Not real-time; requires polling or additional mechanisms for real-time updates.

2.2. Webhooks

	•	How It Works:
	•	OrderHub sends a POST request to a webhook endpoint on PrepStation when an order is placed.
	•	Pros:
	•	Lightweight and decoupled.
	•	Cons:
	•	Less flexible if PrepStation needs to query OrderHub frequently.

2.3. WebSockets

	•	How It Works:
	•	A persistent connection is maintained between services for real-time updates.
	•	OrderHub pushes updates to PrepStation via WebSockets.
	•	Pros:
	•	Real-time communication.
	•	Efficient for high-frequency updates.
	•	Cons:
	•	Complex to implement and scale.

2.4. Cloud Messaging (e.g., Firebase, SNS/SQS, or Kafka)

	•	How It Works:
	•	OrderHub publishes messages (e.g., “new order”) to a cloud messaging service.
	•	PrepStation subscribes to these messages and updates its dashboard accordingly.
	•	Pros:
	•	Asynchronous, highly scalable, and decoupled.
	•	Reliable message delivery.
	•	Cons:
	•	Adds complexity with an external service.

Recommended Architecture

Based on your goals to mimic microservices, here’s the recommended architecture:

3.1. High-Level Design

	•	Landing Page:
	•	Runs on landing.example.com.
	•	A standalone Next.js server for public-facing content.
	•	OrderHub:
	•	Runs on orderhub.example.com.
	•	Customer-facing server handling restaurant browsing and order placement.
	•	Communicates with PrepStation via Cloud Messaging (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging or AWS SNS).
	•	PrepStation:
	•	Runs on prepstation.example.com.
	•	Business-facing server handling restaurant dashboards and real-time updates.

3.2. Communication Flow

	•	Customer Places an Order (OrderHub → PrepStation):
	1.	OrderHub publishes a “New Order” message to a message broker (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, Kafka, or AWS SNS/SQS).
	2.	PrepStation subscribes to the topic and receives the order details in real-time.
	•	Menu Updates (PrepStation → OrderHub):
	1.	PrepStation sends an update (via REST API or message broker) to notify OrderHub about menu changes.
	2.	OrderHub processes and updates its restaurant listings accordingly.
	•	Shared Authentication:
Use a shared authentication provider (e.g., Clerk, Auth0, or Firebase Auth) across all three services to maintain a unified login experience.

3.3. Message Broker

	•	Firebase Cloud Messaging:
	•	Great for real-time notifications and updates.
	•	Works well for web, mobile, and server-to-server communication.
	•	AWS SNS + SQS:
	•	Use SNS for publishing updates and SQS for queueing messages if reliability is critical.
	•	Apache Kafka:
	•	Excellent for high-throughput systems requiring event streaming.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Database Design

Option 1: Shared Database

	•	Use a single database instance shared across OrderHub and PrepStation.
	•	Each service has access to the relevant tables (e.g., Orders, Menus, Restaurants).
	•	Pros: Simpler to manage.
	•	Cons: Tightly coupled; harder to scale independently.

Option 2: Separate Databases

	•	Each service has its own database:
	•	OrderHub DB: Handles customer data, orders, and restaurant listings.
	•	PrepStation DB: Handles restaurant configurations and order management.
	•	Use a message broker for syncing data between databases.
	•	Pros: True microservices architecture; independent scaling.
	•	Cons: Requires more effort to manage consistency.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Authentication

To handle authentication across all three services:
	1.	Use a Centralized Provider:
	•	Use Clerk, Auth0, or Firebase Auth to provide authentication for all servers.
	•	Share tokens between services for unified user sessions.
	2.	Subdomain Cookies:
	•	Use cookies with the Domain=.example.com attribute so they work across all subdomains (e.g., landing.example.com, orderhub.example.com, and prepstation.example.com).
--------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment and Scaling

	•	Hosting: Use a platform like Vercel or AWS for deploying each Next.js server.
	•	Domain Structure:
	•	landing.example.com → Landing Page Server.
	•	orderhub.example.com → OrderHub Server.
	•	prepstation.example.com → PrepStation Server.
	•	Load Balancing:
	•	Use a load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB or NGINX) to distribute traffic and scale servers.
	•	Message Broker:
	•	Deploy your message broker (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging or Kafka) to handle real-time communication between services.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Summary Architecture

	1.	Landing Page: A lightweight server for marketing content.
	2.	OrderHub: Customer-facing server, communicates with PrepStation via message broker.
	3.	PrepStation: Business-facing dashboard, updates OrderHub via REST or message broker.
	4.	Message Broker: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging, Kafka, or AWS SNS/SQS for communication.
	5.	Authentication: Shared provider (e.g., Clerk or Firebase Auth) for consistent user sessions.
